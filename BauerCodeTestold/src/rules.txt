Each bidder can bid only once for each item.
All bidders bid the starting bid unless other rules come into effect.
All bidders stop bidding when they have insufficient funds to bid.
The bidder with the highest bid wins the item.
If a bidder wins an item, the bidder's starting balance should be decreased by the amount of the bid.
If a bidder does not win an item, the bidder's balance is not decreased.
If more than one rule would multiply a bidders bid, multiply the starting bid by the multiplier in each applicable rule. 
If a rule dictates that a bidder will bid a maximum amount, that amount cannot be exceded even if other rules would produce a total over that amount.
Bidding 0 dollars is the equivalent of not bidding.
